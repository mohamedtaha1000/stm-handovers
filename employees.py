employees.py
============
Recognising a person across their documents, and working out what they
still hold.

There is no employee table in this app - only documents, each carrying
its own copy of the person's details. So "the same person" is a
judgement (employee_identity), "have I made this one before" is a
judgement (find_duplicate), and "which laptop do they have" means
reading every document they appear on. Those judgements live here rather
than among the routes: they are the rules most likely to need changing,
and the ones worth being able to read on their own.

No Flask. Given the rows, every function here is a pure question about
them.
