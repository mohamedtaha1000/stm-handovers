============
Turning a submitted form into a stored Word document: validating what
was typed, naming the file, filling it, and writing the result onto a
Handover row.

No Flask. Everything here takes plain values and returns plain values or
a sentence describing what went wrong, which is what lets the same code
serve one document, an edit, and a batch of ten - and lets these rules
be exercised without starting a web server.
