========
The Word-document engine: everything this project knows about editing a
.docx without disturbing it.

Deliberately knows NOTHING about STM, handovers or any particular
template - no document type is named in this file. It is the layer the
builders sit on: find a run, replace a placeholder, keep a value's
right-to-left flag matching its script, level a spec table, fit it to
the page. Given a different set of Word templates it would still work.

Every function edits only the specific data runs inside a template's XML
(never the fixed Arabic/English labels around them), so the original
formatting, fonts, RTL layout and table structure are preserved exactly
- only the data changes. Values are auto-detected as Arabic or Latin
script and that run's bidi flag is fixed to match, which is what stops
the "/" and the Arabic labels gluing themselves to the values.

    Inspecting a document the user actually generated and flagged found
    the real root cause of the "mobile number before its label" bug:
    that paragraph was right-aligned (<w:jc w:val="right"/>) but had NO
    <w:bidi/> - so its base paragraph direction was left-to-right even
    though it's full of Arabic text. With an LTR base direction, the
    Unicode bidi algorithm treats the Arabic label as the *first*
    logical segment (placed at the left of the line) and the embedded
    LTR mobile-number run as the *second* (placed at the right, i.e.
    right up against the right-aligned margin) - so reading right to
    left, as any Arabic reader does, the number is exactly what's
    encountered first. Word reproduced this; LibreOffice happened not
    to. Most label/value cells across these templates turned out to
    share this same jc="right"-without-bidi combination (evidently how
    the original source documents were authored) - so it isn't unique to
    the mobile field, which is why it needs to be fixed everywhere at
    once rather than patched for one field. See set_value(), which calls
    this automatically for any paragraph containing Arabic text."""

    script of the new text (Arabic vs Latin/digits).

    Defensive: a handful of source runs in the original templates had no
    <w:rPr> at all, which meant they silently inherited the document's
    docDefaults font size (12pt) instead of the 9pt used everywhere else
    in these tables - that mismatch is what caused values like a long
    job title to wrap awkwardly instead of fitting the column. If a run
    is missing rPr, give it one at the same 9pt size the rest of the
    table uses instead of leaving it to chance.

    Also defensive: some of the newer source documents have leftover
    placeholder runs colored white-on-white (a cursor-position spacer the
    original author never meant to be read) - writing a real value into
    one of those would silently vanish. Any run this function fills in
    is meant to be visible, so an explicit white/near-white w:color is
    dropped (falling back to the document's normal black) rather than
    trusted.

    A user reported a real (MS Word) document where a mobile number ended
    up displayed on the wrong side of its Arabic label - reading
    right-to-left, the digits came before "رقم الموبيل/" instead of
    after it. Inspecting the actual generated file found the paragraph
    was missing <w:bidi/> (see ensure_bidi() below, which this function
    now calls automatically) - that was the real cause. On top of that
    fix, two more defensive changes close every other gap the same class
    of bug could hide in: an explicit w:val="0" is now always written
    (never just left "absent") for a non-Arabic run's own w:rtl flag, and
    the text itself is wrapped in Left-to-Right Marks (U+200E, invisible)
    so the run's position is also pinned by the Unicode bidi algorithm
    directly, independent of any single flag or engine's handling of it."""

# token (FILL_NAME, FILL_SERIAL, ...) instead of being addressed by
# hand-counted run indexes. That is what broke the old code: every time
# the source .docx was re-saved from Word, the runs were re-split and
# the counted offsets pointed at the wrong text.
#
# Matching on the token itself is immune to that - Word can re-split the
# runs however it likes, the token still says what it is. These helpers
# do the replacement; each fill function below just supplies the mapping.

# hand in Word over a long time and its six label/value cells drifted

# label and the rest put it after, two cells start with stray tab runs
# that shove the value halfway across the column, the labels sit at
# different font sizes (some bold, some not), and nothing lines up
# vertically because the cells disagree on alignment. Filling values into
# that as-is just prints a mess, however correct the values are.
#

# label/value pair in that one table to a single canonical shape -
# "الاسم بالكامل/ <value>", right-aligned in a proper RTL paragraph, label
# and value sharing the table's dominant font - which is what makes the
# two columns line up into two clean vertical rails.
