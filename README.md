# STM Handover Documents

An internal Flask web application for generating STM's handover and
receipt Word documents from a browser form, replacing manual editing of
`.docx` files. Every generated document is logged to a searchable,
filterable history with export and print support.

## Overview

Users log in with a shared team password, choose a document type, fill
in a form, and download the completed `.docx`. Supported document types:

| Document type              | Description                              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Laptop handover              | Issuing a laptop to an employee            |
| Laptop replacement           | Swapping an employee's laptop for a new one (records both the returned and issued device) |
| Keyboard & mouse handover     | Issuing a keyboard-and-mouse combo kit to an employee |
| Mouse handover                | Issuing a mouse (on its own) to an employee |
| Screen handover               | Issuing a monitor to an employee           |
| Router handover                | Issuing a SIM/data router to an employee   |
| Headset handover               | Issuing a headset to an employee           |
| Printer handover                | Issuing a printer to an employee          |
| Flash drive handover             | Issuing a USB flash drive to an employee |
| Hard disk handover               | Issuing an external hard disk to an employee |

Each document type is defined in a single registry
(`templates.py::TEMPLATES`), which drives the home page, the form for
each document type, and the underlying `.docx` template — adding a new
type does not require changing the Flask routes or HTML pages (see
[Adding a new document type](#adding-a-new-document-type)).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- The packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Running locally

```bash
cd webapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if not already present) and set two
values:

```
SECRET_KEY=<a random long string>
TEAM_PASSWORD=<a password to share with your team>
```

Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY` with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Start the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000**, log in with any display name and the
team password, and generate a document. `.env` is loaded automatically
on startup — no environment variables need to be set manually in the
shell.

On first run this creates:
- `instance/handovers.db` — a local SQLite database of generated documents
- `generated/` — the generated `.docx` files, named
  `<Name> - <Document type> - <Date>.docx` (e.g.
  `Yasmin Mohamed - Laptop handover - 2026-09-10.docx`); if the same
  person generates the same document type again on the same day, `(2)`,
  `(3)`, etc. is appended instead of overwriting the earlier file

Both directories are excluded from version control (see `.gitignore`).

## Configuration

| Variable        | Required | Description                                            |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `SECRET_KEY`      | Yes      | Signs Flask session cookies. Any long random string.       |
| `TEAM_PASSWORD`   | Yes      | Shared password required to log in.                        |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | No       | Overrides the default SQLite database (e.g. a Postgres connection string) with no code changes required. |
| `PORT`            | No       | Port to listen on when run directly with `python app.py` (default `5000`). |
| `FLASK_DEBUG`      | No       | Set to `0` to disable Flask's debug/auto-reload mode.      |
| `HANDOVER_NOTIFY_TO`   | No   | Who the "this has been handed over" email is addressed to. Unset means the draft opens with an empty To line. |
| `HANDOVER_NOTIFY_NAME` | No   | How that email greets its recipient (default `Eng. Hegazy`). |
| `HANDOVER_EMS_TO`      | No   | Who the leaver's EMS deactivation email is addressed to. |
| `HANDOVER_LEAVER_TO`   | No   | Who the leaver's resignation email is addressed to. |
| `HANDOVER_REGISTER_PATH` | No | Where the laptop register `.xlsx` is written (default `laptop_register.xlsx` beside the app). Rebuilt automatically on every change. |

The app refuses to start with the placeholder `TEAM_PASSWORD` value —
it must be set before running.

## Features

### Document generation

Each document type has its own form, generated from its field list in
`templates.py`. Required fields are validated server-side; mobile
number and National ID fields are additionally checked against a
regular expression (11-digit Egyptian mobile number, 14-digit national
ID) before a document is generated, with the specific problem shown
inline if a value doesn't match.

### History

Every generated document is recorded with the submitting user's name,
department, position, national ID (masked to the last 4 digits in list
views), document type, and the date and time it was generated. The
History page supports:

- **Search** — matches name, department, or position
- **Filters** — by document type, and by a from/to date range (based on
  generation date)
- **Pagination** — 50 records per page
- **Print** — a print-friendly view of the current filtered results,
  with navigation and controls hidden
- **Export to Excel** — downloads the current filtered results as an
  `.xlsx` file (national ID masked the same way as on screen)
- **Delete** — permanently removes a record and its generated `.docx`
  file, after a confirmation prompt. Any logged-in user can delete any
  record.

Search, filters, and pagination are reflected in the URL, so a filtered
view can be bookmarked or shared.

## Deployment

The application is a standard Flask app and can be deployed to any
platform that runs Python (Render, Railway, PythonAnywhere, an internal
server, etc.). Example using **Render**:

1. Push this folder to its own **private** GitHub repository —
   `doc_templates/` contains STM's internal document layouts and should
   not be made public.
2. On [render.com](https://render.com), create a **New → Web Service**
   and connect the repository.
3. Set the build and start commands:
   - Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start command: `gunicorn app:app`
4. Set the environment variables `SECRET_KEY` and `TEAM_PASSWORD` (see
   [Configuration](#configuration)).
5. Deploy. Render provides a URL (e.g.
   `https://stm-handover.onrender.com`) to share with the team, along
   with the `TEAM_PASSWORD`.

**Note on free hosting tiers:** platforms like Render's free tier use an
*ephemeral* filesystem — the SQLite database and generated files can be
lost on restart or redeploy. For reliable long-term history, either:

- attach a persistent disk (available on paid plans), or
- point `DATABASE_URL` at a managed database (e.g. Render's free
  Postgres tier) — no code changes required.

Railway and PythonAnywhere follow a similar process: connect the
repository, set the two required environment variables, and point the
start command at `gunicorn app:app`.

## Security notes

This application collects national ID numbers and other personal
employee data. Before deploying it somewhere reachable outside STM's
internal network, review the following:

- **Authentication** is a single shared password for the whole team —
  it gates every page, but does not distinguish between individual
  users beyond the display name they type at login.
- **National IDs are masked** in list views (last 4 digits only). The
  full number is still present in the generated `.docx` file and
  briefly on the confirmation page immediately after generation, since
  it is required in the document itself.
- **Change `SECRET_KEY` and `TEAM_PASSWORD`** from any placeholder
  values before deploying.
- Consider checking with STM's IT/security function before hosting real
  employee national IDs anywhere reachable from outside the office
  network, even behind a password. At minimum, use a host that provides
  HTTPS by default, and do not share the URL or password outside the
  team.
- If access is only needed from the office, hosting on an internal
  server reachable only over the company network/VPN removes the public
  exposure entirely.

## Adding a new document type

1. Obtain a real, filled-in example of the new document.
2. Sanitize it into a placeholder template (`FILL_*` placeholders
   replacing real values) and add it to `doc_templates/`.
3. Write a corresponding fill function in `templates.py`.
4. Add an entry to the `TEMPLATES` dict describing the document's label,
   template file, fill function, and field list.

No other file needs to change — the home page and the document's form
are generated from the registry.

## Possible future enhancements

- Individual per-user logins in place of the single shared password
- Rate limiting, CSRF tokens, and other production-hardening measures
- Restricting who can delete a given history entry to its creator
