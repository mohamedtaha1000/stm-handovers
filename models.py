=========
What the app stores, and nothing else: two tables, and the small
migration that keeps an older database readable.

Split out of app.py so "what is a Handover" is answerable without
reading past thirty routes, and so the domain modules can be handed rows
to work on without importing the web application. The SQLAlchemy object
is created unbound here and attached to the app in app.py, which is what
lets this module be imported on its own.
